# Grocery List App

## Overview
This Grocery List App is a simple, user-friendly web application that allows users to select their grocery categories, choose specific items within those categories, and specify details like quantity, unit, and max value for each item. The app generates a YAML configuration based on user inputs, demonstrating a basic interaction flow with HTML and JavaScript.
